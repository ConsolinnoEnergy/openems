# io.openems.edge.temperatureBoard Provider


## Description

The TemperatureModule needs to be configured by the user.
The User declares what dipswitches (== Spi Channels internally) are activated.
It's possible to set a frequency for the Mcps, but if you don't know what to do, use the default Frequency.
Additionally Mcps are created and added to the spi list.
