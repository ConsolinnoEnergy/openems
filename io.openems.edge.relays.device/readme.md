# io.openems.edge.relais Provider

## Description

The RelaysActuator adds a RelaysTask to the Mcp, therefore it will be controlled.
Depending if the Relays is On or Off, the status will be set. 
The Task treatmenet is fairly simple. It just sets a boolean.
There's just a logic spin, if the Relays is an Opener (on activating no voltage) or closer
(on activating voltage).
