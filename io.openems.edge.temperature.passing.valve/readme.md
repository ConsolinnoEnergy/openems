# io.openems.edge.temperature.passing.valve Provider

## Description

This Bundle implements a Valve. The Valve needs 2 activated relays to function.
It will be controlled via percentage values.
The user needs to declare a "valve-time" (full time till it's completely opened/closed).
Depending on that the valve calculates it's time it needs to open/close itself for a certain % value.
